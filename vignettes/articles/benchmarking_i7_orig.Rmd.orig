# DISCLAIMER

The present benchmark was conducted on `r Sys.Date()` on a Intel® Core™ i7-10510U (8-core CPU, Intel® UHD Graphics (CML GT2) GPU, 16GB RAM, Fedora 42). Results _will_ vary depending on the hardware. These benchmarks aim to provide a general idea of the performance differences between the `fio` package and other implementations but should not be considered definitive. The performance of the functions may also vary depending on the specific data used and the context in which they are applied.

# Introduction

This vignette presents a benchmarking analysis comparing the performance of functions from the `fio` package with equivalent base R functions and functions from other packages. The `fio` package provides a set of functions for input-output analysis, a method used in economics to analyze the interdependencies between different sectors of an economy.

Our benchmarking tests show that `fio` package functions are either faster or more memory-efficient than other implementations. This improved performance can make a substantial difference in larger analyses, making the `fio` package a valuable tool for input-output analysis in R.

The tests were run on simulated square matrices, with dimensions ranging from 100x100 up to 2000x2000, and each test was repeated at least 20 times to account for variability. Please note that the results of this benchmarking analysis depend on the specific test datasets used and the hardware on which the algorithms were run. Therefore, the results should be interpreted in the context of these specific conditions.

# Technical coefficients matrix

The technical coefficients matrix calculation, a key and initial step in input-output analysis, was tested using the `compute_tech_coeff()` function from the `{fio}` package, equivalent functions from the `{leontief}` package, and a base R implementation. It consists of dividing each $a_{ij}$ element of the intermediate transactions matrix by the corresponding $x_j$ element of the total production vector^[Or equivalently, multiplying the intermediate transactions matrix by a diagonal matrix constructed from the total production vector.].

Results shows that {fio} is generally faster and uses significantly less memory than the other two implementations, especially for larger matrices (≥500x500). The memory usage of {fio} is approximately half that of Base R and 12% of that used by {leontief}.

# Leontief inverse matrix

The Leontief matrix ($L$) is obtained by subtracting the technical coefficients matrix ($A$) from the identity matrix ($I$); therefore, it has no null rows or columns. This allows for solving the linear system $L \times L^{-1} = I$ through LU decomposition, which is a more efficient method than direct inverse matrix calculation.

Results shows that for larger matrices, `{fio}` is slightly slower than the alternatives, but demonstrates superior memory efficiency, using less than half the memory.

# Sensitivity of dispersion coefficients of variation

To evaluate the performance of linkage-based functions, we benchmarked the sensitivity of dispersion coefficients of variation.

Results shows that {fio} is substantially faster and more memory-efficient than {leontief} across all tested dimensions. Compared to Base R, {fio} is faster for matrices 1000x1000 and larger, while memory usage remains comparable.

```{r benchmark_i7_c, fig.cap="\\label{fig:benchmark_c} {fio} is substantially faster and more memory-efficient than {leontief} across all tested dimensions. Compared to Base R, {fio} is faster for matrices 1000x1000 and larger, while memory usage remains comparable."}

# Field of influence

Since computing the field of influence involves calculating the Leontief inverse matrix for each element of the technical coefficients matrix after an increment, it can be demanding for high-dimensional matrices. Here, we benchmark the base R function and `{fio}`, as there is no similar function in `{leontief}`. For brevity, we limited the matrix dimensions to 100x100 and the number of repetitions to 10.

Results shows that {fio} is faster than the base R implementation and uses vastly less memory. For the 200x200 matrix, {fio} used 625KB, while the base R implementation used 83.73GB. This enormous difference in memory consumption makes the Base R version impractical for larger matrices on most machines.
